                Welcome to my blog! I am At216, an avid programmer with 8+ years of experience. Most of my focus
                in programming has been in web development (especially in web design), but I have recently been experimenting heavily in JavaScript. In addition, I have recently branched
                out over the past year to work with web servers. I have showcased some of my favorite projects 
                (those that are accessible over the internet) below, feel free to check them out in this blog or by 
                following the URL link to see them in your browser. Thanks for stopping by!<br> -At216<br>

                    This project is the literal flagship of my subdomain. I originally registered for this subdomain solely to host 
                    it. This website generates a NodeJS server for download in you browser based on provided file path parameters. 
                    I use this site often, when I want to run a local HTTP server on a computer I haven't written a server for. 
                    With a server from this site, you can serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PNG, JPEG, and GIF files. It should be somewhat 
                    straightforward to edit to increase compatibility for other filetypes as well (assuming you have some knowledge 
                    of NodeJS or JavaScript).

                    This is my most recent project (not counting my blog). This is a basic, online computer simulator that 
                    boasts a user-friendly GUI and several 'programs'. I am working to expand this project to include 
                    multiple programs of my own (rather than embedding other websites) and a more advanced desktop/taskbar.

                    This is one of my favorite (and most wanted) projects. Ever since I began programming in HTML, I wanted
                    an simple and online HTML code editor and renderer. I tried to build this as a budding programmer, but 
                    eventually encountered difficulties. Just recently (about 7 years later), I was experimenting with AJAX 
                    and had a revelation moment about rendering HTML code in the browser. I sat down and tinkered with textarea 
                    and iframe elements, ultimately constructing the project I had wished for for so long.
